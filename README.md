# matlab-SSP
This repository contains the Matlab implementations of numerical schemes for the deterministic and stochastic Stefan problem. The repository "matlab-pme" is used as a basic resource to build this code. 
The development of the codes here is a joint effort between Muhammad Awais Khan, Jerome Droniou and Kim Ngan Le.

The schemes presented here are analysed in the article
  Numerical analysis of the stochastic Stefan problem.

If you use these codes in a publication, please mention this article.

*Note*: Other meshes that can be used to run these matlab codes are available in the HHO-Lapl-OM repository, see https://github.com/jdroniou/HHO-Lapl-OM.
